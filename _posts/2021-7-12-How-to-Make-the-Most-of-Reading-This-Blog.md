title: How to Make the Most of Reading This Blog
---

In this post I will be giving advice for making the most out of reading my blog, targeted toward incoming college freshmen but applicable to all students!

### 1. Take notes

First, find a quiet place to sit and open up your laptop. Then, read one of my previous posts and take notes. Take notes on what you feel is the most important information from each post. You can use these notes as a test for yourself later on in order to see how much you actually paid attention to what I wrote.

You might be asking yourself why I would want you to take notes on my blog posts, but it is because I believe that if you do this there is more of a chance that you will retain the information later on in college and apply it to real life situations. If not, then at least you got some good advice out of my blog posts!

### 2. Read the posts out loud

This is good practice for being able to speak in public, and will help you with your reading comprehension. I also think it is more fun to read my posts out loud with an accent, which is why I do it! This will allow you to experience my blog posts in a different way than you normally would, and hopefully make you want to use my advice when making future decisions.

### 3. Make a note of the next milestone in your life and come back in 6 months and see how things have changed

If all goes well, hopefully you will be able to come back to this blog after 10 months and see how much more successful you are than you are now. Hopefully by applying the advice from my previous blog posts, you will be in an even better position than before. Remember to check back in on this blog once every week for more help!

### 4. Take notes again!

You might have forgotten some things from the posts that I wrote before this one, so take notes on those as well! Do not forget about the ones that you took in step 1 though!

### 5. Take more notes…but this time listen to classical music while doing it!

It has been scientifically proven by many College Professors and Scientists alike that listening to classical music while taking notes will allow for better memory retention than if you were just listening to hip hop or rap music while taking notes with no background noise in the room at all. This is because classical music helps your brain focus on what is important, and blocks out all of those other distractions such as friends talking, cars honking outside, etc. Also note-taking while listening to classical music will increase your IQ by 10 points instantly! That's science!

### 6. Read over the notes that you took…but this time speak out loud!

This is good practice for public speaking, and will allow you to experience my blog posts in a different way than you normally would. I also think it is more fun to read my posts out loud with an accent, which is why I do it! This will allow you to experience my advice when making future decisions.

### 7. Read the post again until you are sick of hearing about it!

I know that some of my posts can be a bit long and hard to read at times, so feel free to edit out parts of my posts that you do not like. You can replace them with whatever you want, or leave it as is if you do not mind the text being there.

### 8. Share my posts on Facebook and Twitter

The best way to share my blog is to post links to it on your own social media accounts. This will spread the word about this blog, and help me get more followers. Also, I could use all of the support I can get for spreading my message!

### 9. Share with your friends

If you have any friends, then I would love it if you could share my blog posts with them. The more people who read this blog, the better! If they like my advice, they might even follow me on Twitter or Facebook.

### 10. Make sure your parents read the post as well!

If your parents were to read this post then they would learn how to get the most out of reading this blog as well! Remember what we said before? If your parents were able to get the most out of reading this blog then they could use these tips in real life situations such as their jobs, or even helping their children with homework! Who knows how many lives could be changed if people practiced what I have written on this blog? Let's find out together!

### 11. Take a nap, you deserve it after all that hard work!

If you have taken all of my advice up until this point, then you should be fully prepared for your freshman year of college! If you have any friends, then please share my blog posts with them as well. They will surely get a lot out of it!

### 12. Make sure that you do not forget to take notes again!

What would be the point of having this blog if no one took notes on what I wrote? You can never be too careful with note-taking, because I do not want you to forget the important life lessons that I have taught you!
