title: How to Develop Social Skills
---

1. The very first thing you must do is make friends.

If you want your social skills to develop, you must have friends. This is because it is difficult to practice socializing with strangers, but easy to practice socializing with friends. Friends are the best way to become socially skilled before an interview or networking event. Here are some tips on how to find friends:

Go out of your way to meet new people. There will be plenty of opportunities at orientation and events so don't worry about being awkward in the beginning!

Go out of your way to make friends with people who seem like they would be interested in talking with you or working together on projects. It's easier if it's a mutual interest such as a class or extracurricular activity that both of you can relate to each other through. When I first got into Stanford (Online High School), I was extremely nervous and intimidated by the students there (I was just entering the top 3% of my class). I decided that since everyone there was a nerd, I would try to make friends with more nerds than anyone else during orientation week which went well for me and my classmate (who is now one of my closest friends).

2. Practice your social skills before any interview/networking event through role-play.

If you want your social skills to develop, you must practice them! If you just constantly go out and try to make friends with people without trying at any role-play first, then you will be extremely awkward and uncomfortable when it comes time for the actual event. Here are some tips on how to practice your social skills before an interview or networking event:

Role-play with a friend. Have your friend pretend that they are an interviewer and you pretend to be a candidate. If your friend is not comfortable doing this, then try role-playing on your own by pretending that you're the interviewer and interviewing yourself! This will help you figure out what to say in the event of an interview so that nothing comes off as awkward or inappropriate.

3. Practice socializing in front of a mirror until it feels natural or watch videos of others doing the same until it becomes comfortable for you too.

If you want your social skills to develop further, then using a mirror will help you practice body language and facial expressions since there's no one else around but just yourself! If there's any discomfort with watching yourself in front of a mirror, then watch videos of people practicing social skills instead! It does not matter if you use a mirror or videos; what matters is that if feels natural after practicing it enough times. Here are some tips on how to practice your social skills in front of a mirror or watching videos of others:

Practice smiling! If you're not very confident with the way you smile, then practice showing different types of smiles to see which one you like the most. It's also important to remember that your eyes should always be smiling; if your eyes are not smiling, then neither is your smile.

Practice eye contact! Does it feel comfortable when you talk to someone and they look into your eyes? If not, then practice making eye contact with a friend or family member until it feels natural.

Practice hand gestures! Try out different hand gestures that you think would work well for you and see which ones feel most comfortable for you. It is important to remember to keep your hands away from your face in any social situation as this is usually perceived as a sign of discomfort and nervousness.

4. Be confident in who you are and what you have accomplished! Don't be afraid to tell others about your accomplishments and have a healthy self-esteem! This is critical to developing your social skills because if you are not confident in yourself, then it will be hard for you to make friends with others. Here are some tips on how to be confident in who you are and what you have accomplished:

Write down all the things that make you proud of yourself and remember that even if other people don't think those accomplishments are important, they're still very significant for yourself. I like using this method because whenever I feel like my confidence is low, I can always look at my list of accomplishments and see how much I've done already!

Tell someone about a recent accomplishment that makes you proud of yourself (such as getting accepted into Stanford University's high school class). Tell them why this achievement makes you proud and be sure to use eye contact when explaining it! I like using this one because when I explain what makes me proud about what I've done recently, I feel proud myself, and I can use that positive emotion to rub off on others.
