title: How to Get Free Books
---

I got my first year of books free by using the following strategy. The strategy involves two concepts: networking and advertising.

### 1. Networking:

The first thing to do is to make sure you have a directory of the faculty members at your university. Most universities provide these directories on their website. If your university does not have an online directory, you can probably find one on Google by searching for “[YOUR_UNIVERSITY] Faculty Directory” or something similar. Just use the search bar in the upper left corner of this page to get started!

Once you have that information, you should start making connections with as many professors as possible using Facebook and LinkedIn, which are free social network services. You should use social media because it allows you to network quickly and easily without having to spend much money (i.e., time). Some professors may be willing to give away some of their books for free just because they like your profile picture or status updates on Facebook — who knows? Just make good friends with them.

### 2. Advertising:

Once you have a directory of all the professors in your university, you should start advertising to them. This can be done by sending emails, calling them on the phone, or going up to them and talking directly. This is a very effective strategy because it allows you to interact with the professors and make them remember you.

Now, here is how I use these two concepts to get my first year of books free:

First, I use the directory to find out who teaches each of the classes that I will be taking. Then, I send them an email with a short introduction and a link to my Facebook profile (or LinkedIn). In this email, I tell the professor about my high GPA and my experience in Computer Science. After sending the email, I wait for a few days until their response comes through. If they do not respond, I try calling them on the phone. If they do not answer, I go up to the professor in person and ask them how they are doing. If they still do not respond after that, I move onto the next step.

Once I get a response from the professors (in any form), I schedule an appointment with them. For this meeting, I bring my laptop with me and show the professor my social media profiles and websites that I have built. Some professors may find this impressive enough to give away some of their books for free — you never know! After we finish talking, if they give me any books or offer any kind of financial support for school/books, I thank them for their generosity and leave immediately so that they can get back to work. Usually, after leaving their office, I send them an email saying “thank you for your time” and “I hope we can stay in touch” or something similar.

Now that you understand these two concepts, keep practicing until you master them! Then you will be able to reap all of the benefits of getting your first year of books free using these two simple strategies! Good luck!
