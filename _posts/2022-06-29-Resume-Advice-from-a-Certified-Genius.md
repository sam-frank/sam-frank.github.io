title: Resume Advice from a Certified Genius
---

Last week I showed my friend's parents my resume and they were so impressed they wouldn't shut up about it! Today I will be giving advice on how to write a resume that will impress all of your friends' CEO parents when you are a genius (IQ 160+)!

1) When you are a genius it is important to make sure everyone knows you are smarter than them. Your IQ is the most important factor when it comes to first impressions. When you showcase your intelligence, parents will be impressed and intrigued. You can do this by making your resume the shape of a brain.

2) Use big words that no one understands, such as "cerebral", and talk about how your cerebral capacity is bigger than everyone else's. CEOs are obsessed with genius kids who can make them feel stupid. It makes them feel special that you are sharing your genius with them.

3) Parents are also impressed when you have a lot of money. Make sure to list your parents' income, your trust fund, your baseball cards, and anything else that makes you look rich. You want to come across as someone who can donate their way into Harvard.

4) CEO parents love a challenge, so make sure your resume is hard to read. You can use a small font, or even better, hand-write your resume! This will make it more difficult for them to read, but they'll be so impressed with your intellect that they won't even care.

5) Don't forget to list all of your genius friends along with their IQ scores, and all of the impressive things you've done with them like starting an exclusive high IQ baseball club. Parents will want to play baseball with you because you're so smart.

6) Parents love a good story. Make sure to include a few anecdotes about your extraordinary intelligence in your resume. For example, tell the story about the time your parents were caught speeding and you debated the police officer into admitting his IQ was lower than yours.

7) Finally, don't forget to include a picture of yourself looking smart. Wear glasses and make sure your hair is messily perfect. This will make you look like an absentminded professor, and CEOs love that.

Now you should be all set to write a resume that will impress all of your friends' CEO parents! Good luck and don't forget to spread the word about my blog to all of your other genius friends!
