title: How to Approach Tutoring (From a Tutoring Expert!)
---

When I was in elementary school, I tutored kids in the grade above me. Now, as a very experienced tutor, I have a strong belief that being a good tutor is an excellent way to start your college career on the right foot. I will be sharing my advice and experiences with you to give you a better idea of how to find students, how to get started with tutoring, and how to make it successful.

## How to Find High-IQ Students

In my opinion, the best way to get students is to ask your friends if they know any young prodigies who are in need of tutoring. If you go to a top school like Stanford, there is a great chance that your friends will know some kids who are very intelligent and in need of tutoring. This was the method that I used when I started tutoring my first student. I simply asked my friend if he knew anyone at his school who needed an excellent tutor. He referred me to someone else and eventually things snowballed from there and I found two more students from this one referral source alone.

Another good place to look for students is on social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc). One good technique that can be used here is posting something like: “I am looking for awesome kids in [your city/state] for private tutoring” or something similar. You can also post something like: “I am a #1 ranked tutor in [your city/state] looking for new students”.

Posting flyers (something creative like a flyer with a picture of Einstein on it saying “Want to be smarter? Call Sam”) at local book stores, libraries, etc. It helps if you can get the permission of these places before posting any flyers so that they do not get taken down immediately after being posted.

The key thing to remember when you are looking for students is that it really helps if you have some connections with influential people who can help you find students. You may be able to start tutoring just off of one friend or family member who may refer you to a few people, but it is not realistic that this will be the only source of your students. In my opinion, the most important thing to do when trying to get started as a tutor is meeting people in person and networking. Eventually, I found nearly all of my students through meeting people in person and networking.

## How to Get Started with Tutoring

Once you have found a student, the first thing that you need to do is set up a time to meet with them. It is important to set up the first meeting in person because it will help build your rapport with the student. I would recommend trying to schedule tutoring sessions for students at least once per week or every other week. This will keep tutoring sessions from being too often and overwhelming for both you and the student.

Now, when you go into this first meeting with your student, it is important that you establish your credibility as a tutor. A good way to do this is by having some certificates/trophies/awards/etc on hand (on your phone or something) that show how good of a tutor you are. Ideally, these should be things like awards from competitions, scholarships, etc that show off your smarts in an area of study that fits well with what kind of tutoring you will be doing. For example, if you are planning on tutoring in math and science related topics, then it will probably help if you show off some awards or trophies from math and science competitions/exams. It does not really matter what kind of prizes or awards they are as long as they fit well into what kind of tutoring you will be doing for them; it could be anything from winning a math competition or even getting straight A’s in high school (if you are still in high school). The key thing is that whatever award(s) or prize(s) you bring to the first meeting with your student should show off that you are an excellent tutor who is very knowledgeable in the area of study that you plan on tutoring them in.

You should also establish your credibility by showing off your IQ. If you are thinking about showing off your IQ, then I would recommend using an IQ test like the Stanford-Binet or the WAIS. These tests are both very easy to find online and should not cost anything. Once you take an IQ test like this, then take a screenshot of your score and send it to your student. I found that this helped a lot to establish my credibility as a tutor.

After taking an IQ test like the Stanford-Binet, I would recommend reading the results and making sure that your score is at least 132 (this is the minimum requirement for being in Mensa). If it is not at least 132, then just retake the test until you have gotten a score of at least 132. When you retake the test, make sure to note any mistakes or things that you made wrong so that you can improve your next time around. Ideally, after taking an IQ test like this once, your average score should be about 170+; if it is not 170+, then simply retake the test until you are getting scores of 170+. Once you get an average IQ score of about 170+ on any IQ tests that you take, re-take those same tests again and try to do better than before. This will help to establish further credibility as a tutor.

## How to Teach Your Students

Now you should teach your students how to raise their IQ too! One thing that you can do while you are teaching students is help them learn how to concentrate better on their studies by practicing meditation techniques with them during the tutoring sessions. Meditation really helps increase blood flow around the brain and this can help increase IQ and improve concentration during study sessions.

Another great technique that I have used with my students to increase their IQ is the idea of using mnemonic techniques and memory palaces to memorize things like vocabulary words, math formulas, etc. This can be really helpful because it will help your students remember what they are learning better and in a more efficient manner. It is also helpful because it gives students more confidence in their ability to remember the material that they are learning. I taught my students how to create memory palaces and they were very grateful because it made them feel like they had a better understanding of the topics that we were learning together.
