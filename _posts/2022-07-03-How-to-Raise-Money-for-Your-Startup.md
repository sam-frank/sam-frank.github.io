title: How to Raise Money for Your Startup
---

Some people read my other blog post and complained that they had selfish parents who aren't willing to invest $120k into their startup. So now I will be giving advice on how to raise money for your startup!

In addition to the $120k I got from my parents, I also raised money in a genius way. I organized a "Charity Startup" event where people could come and play baseball, eat food, and donate to my cause. I raised over $5k from that one event! Here's how I organized it:

First, I found a place to have the event. My family has a big (very big) backyard, so I asked my mom if we could use it and she said yes!

Second, I advertised the event on social media. I made a Facebook page and invited all of my friends. Then I invited all my parents' friends. And then I invited all of my friends' parents.

Third, I organized the event itself. I set up a baseball diamond in our backyard and asked my friend's dad to be the pitcher. I set up a barbecue and asked my friend's mom to make hamburgers and hot dogs. (My mom and dad were busy playing video games with another friend's parents.) I made some flyers and put them around the neighborhood, which was kind of useless since everyone in the neighborhood was already at my baseball game.

Fourth, I collected the money. At the end of the event, I had a bucket where people could donate to Charity Startup. I also told everyone that they could donate online through my website and follow me on social media.

In total, I raised over $5k from that one event! And it was all because of my amazing organizational skills and ability to get people to help me out.

If you have a high IQ like me, you can learn to do this too! Just follow my advice:

First, you need to find a friend's dad to be the pitcher. Show him your hand-written brain-shaped resume, and he'll be so impressed that he won't stop bragging to his wife that he got invited as the pitcher.

Second, get that friend's mom to cook burgers and hot dogs. If her husband hasn't made her jealous enough that she's already willing to help, she'll be more likely to help if you tell her that her kid is Mensa material like you are.

Third, you need to make some flyers and put them around the neighborhood. What they say depends on what your startup is about. For example, if your startup is about cultivating one's inner Einstein, then the flyers could say something like, "Einstein was a genius, and so are you! Come learn about how Einstein is a part of you!"

Fourth, you need to collect the money. Put a bucket at the end of your event that is large enough to fit at least $10k in pennies in it, in case your guests have a bit too much spare change on them.

By following my advice, you too can raise money for your startup in a genius way, even if you have stingy parents! Good luck and donâ€™t forget to share my blog with all of your young CEO friends and everyone who shows up at your baseball game!
