title: Expert Advice on Founding a Successful Non-profit
---

Today I’m giving advice to incoming college freshmen on the topic of how to be a successful non-profit founder like me. I will talk about how to find a cause you believe in, how to get funding and volunteers, and how to make your non-profit successful.

You are here because you want to save the world, and I am here to help!

### How to Find a Cause You Believe In

You need to start a non-profit, but you don’t know what your non-profit is supposed to be about. So what do you do? Think about the things that bother you in the world and think about what you believe in. The key is to find a cause that matters to you and that you can connect with.

For example, let’s say you hate seeing genius go undeveloped. Maybe you have an uncle who is amazingly smart but didn’t get into Stanford because he didn’t study hard enough. You know that this guy is a top-notch genius, and you feel bad about it. So maybe your cause would be to promote the genius within everyone and help people get into the school of their dreams.

Or maybe you are really passionate about animal rights. Maybe one day your dog got hit by a car, and you were too busy with schoolwork to take care of him/her properly, so the dog died in pain and misery without anyone by his side. This may make you think about how many other animals die every year because they don’t have someone to protect them from bad situations or cruel people. So maybe your non-profit will be aimed at helping these defenseless animals like beavers, tigers, etc…

Or maybe you are passionate about baseball. Maybe you feel guilty because when you were younger, your parents put so much pressure on you to study hard that you didn’t spend enough time playing baseball. So you want to help under-privileged kids play more baseball.

You can find a cause that matters to you, even if it is something as silly as saving cats from the evil forces of big dogs. The most important thing is that you believe in the cause and are willing to commit yourself 100% of your time and energy, which brings me to my next point:

### How To Get People To Volunteer Their Time For Free!

If you have good social skills like me, you can find volunteers and people who are willing to give you their time and energy for free!

Here is how:

First, be confident. People will want to work with you if they feel like you know what you are doing. If they think that you have a plan or some kind of strategy, they will want to help you out. The confidence game works everywhere from fundraising meetings with millionaires to job interviews with top tech companies like Google and Facebook. If people believe in your cause, then they will help you out! (Note: You won’t be able to convince people that you are confident if you are not actually confident. Anyone can learn how to be confident with a high enough IQ.)

Second, know how to get attention for yourself and your cause. When I was helping kids play baseball, I would write articles about them and publish them online so that more people would see them. Then other news sources would come across my posts and read about the story there, which led their readers to read about it as well… And before you knew it, I was getting interviewed by major newspapers like the LA Times! Now we were getting attention!

For my non-profit, whenever we were planning an event, I would have students from top universities come out and help us run the event. This worked well because everyone wants their name in lights! When people know that their name will appear on our website as someone who helped us with an event, then they will often want to help out just so that their name can appear where it matters.

You can also try to get people’s attention by doing something outrageous. For example, you could go out into the streets and start giving away free kittens to passersby. This might not be the best way to do it, but it would definitely attract a lot of attention for your non-profit!

### How to Get People to Give You Their Money for Free!

Once you have already gotten people’s attention, what else do you need? You need money to help run your non-profit. But how can you get this money for free? It is simple: just ask for donations. The key to getting donations is being confident and aggressive with your requests. Here is how I did it:

First, I built my non-profit’s website and wrote about how awesome my organization was. Then I published this website on Facebook groups related to Stanford students so that Stanford students would know about my organization. Then, to convince them to donate, I asked them if they wanted their name on our list of donors and if they preferred a kitten or a certificate as their thank you gift for their donation. I also emailed my friends and family members to ask them to donate. When a non-profit takes off, it will become quite easy to get money for the cause you believe in!

### How To Get Even More People to Listen to Your Excellent Ideas and Follow Your Brilliant Strategies!

You have volunteers, now what? If you have enough money and time from other people, then you will be able to hire a team of employees or contractors who will help run your non-profit for you. They can do everything for you, including writing your brilliant plans with their own brilliant ideas for how to execute the plan. You can read up on what they wrote and then just simply approve it or modify it as you see fit. If you are not satisfied with something that they wrote, then tell them to change it. This is a great way to make sure that your non-profit is being run in a way that makes sense and will actually solve the problem rather than wasting time and resources on stupid stuff like trying to raise more money or doing more research.

Make sure that you pay these people well so that they won’t quit halfway through the project. I made sure that any contractors I hired were handsomely paid so that they would stick around until the end of whatever project we were working on together. Then, whenever someone quit before finishing their part of the job, I would replace them with another contractor. That way there was always someone there who would follow my commands without any complaints!
