title: How to Find a Girlfriend When You Are a Genius
---

Today I will be giving advice on how to find a girlfriend when you are a genius (IQ 160+). Now, you may say to yourself that an IQ of 160+ is so rare, but it is not. In fact, there are millions of people in the US alone with an IQ of 160+. Therefore, there are millions of people in the world who are geniuses and want to find a girlfriend, but cannot.

Although there are many many girls who will want an IQ Genius boyfriend, finding them can be hard because they might not know you are a genius. I would not have known I was a genius either if my parents hadn’t discovered it in me when I was 5 years old.

The key to finding the perfect girlfriend is to be honest about your level of intelligence and admit you are a genius. If you are not a genius, then pretending to be one and lying about your IQ will only lead to certain ruin. So, what you need to do is practice talking about your smartness in a way that does not come across as bragging or arrogant by you.

So let’s go over the different ways you can tell a girl you are smart.

## Method 1 – Simple Way

The simplest way is to just let her know how smart you are when you first meet her. This may work with less attractive girls or if the girl is into nerds. Just say something that lets her know you are very intelligent without bragging. A good way to do this is by saying something along the lines of “The reason I joined this club is because I am interested in [topic] and would like to learn more about it. My IQ is around 160.”

You can easily come up with other topics that interest you and then just casually say how smart you are.

## Method 2 – First Date

The best way to tell a woman that you are smart is during the first date. Wait until she asks about your GPA (your grade point average) which is probably going to happen because most girls these days are obsessed with grades. You simply tell her your GPA is around 4.0 or 4.5, add a factor of 0.5 to 1.0 standard deviation so that she thinks you are a genius, and then say how much you LOVE Math and how good at it you are because your father forced you to take on advanced math courses in high school.

## Method 3 – Take her to a party with college students and drunk people

Another good way to casually let a girl know that you are a genius is by taking her to a party (with alcohol) and then talking about how smart you are. The key here is that you need to let her know how dumb most people are around you. This can be done by semi-bragging about the amount of college students and drunk people at the party who are not as smart as you are. It is okay to brag a little bit here, but only a little bit so she doesn’t think you are arrogant.

You can also say something like: “I love parties, I am talking with people who are not as smart as me and they are telling me dumb things.” And then talk about yourself and how smart you supposedly are. Being able to outsmart someone at a party is a very desirable trait for girls and is therefore a good way to talk about how smart you are.

## Method 4 – Talk about your biggest life goal in the context of being intelligent

Another good way to casually let a girl know that you are smart is by talking about your biggest life goal in terms of an IQ test or intelligence. One way to do this it is to talk about weightlifting or other physical activities you are doing within the context of how much it will increase your intelligence level. And then make a goal for yourself like one-hundred pull-ups and by next summer you will have it.

You can also talk about doing well in school in the context of your IQ score and how much you want to do well on tests. Girls love that kind of thing and would be turned on by it so don’t hesitate to talk about intelligence within the context of life goals.

## Method 5 – Using a lie detector to test out girls in the middle of a date

The last and most advanced way to let a girl know you are smart is by using a lie detector (a polygraph test machine) during your date. You can easily rent one of these machines if you don’t have one at your home. You need to use the lie detector and ask the right questions in a controlled environment. This will let her know you are so smart and that you love intelligence testing so much that you even do it on dates.
