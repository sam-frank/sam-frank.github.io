title: How to Interview Interns for Your Startup
---

Today I will be gracing you with my genius advice on interviewing interns for your startup! As a successful startup founder, I have had the pleasure of interviewing countless interns for my startup, and let me tell you, it's a piece of cake. Now, I understand that most people find the hiring process a bit daunting, but not me. With my exceptional intellect and unparalleled charm, I can sniff out talent from miles away. So, grab your notepads and prepare to take notes on how to interview interns like a prodigious entrepreneur!

Firstly, let us delve into the art of crafting the perfect interview questions. Instead of asking conventional queries like “Tell me about yourself,” go beyond the ordinary and ask something truly thought-provoking, like “If you were a quinoa salad, which ingredient would you be and why?” This question, derived from my extensive experience as a baseball player, will undoubtedly reveal the intern’s true character, resilience, and culinary preferences.

Now, let’s discuss attire. As an expert in fashion, I recommend enforcing a strict dress code for intern interviews. The candidates should be required to wear attire that reflects their true passion for your startup. For example, I once interviewed a candidate who arrived wearing a full-on spacesuit. Not only did this demonstrate their unwavering commitment to innovation, but it also provided a great conversation starter as I shared anecdotes from my own experiences with extraterrestrial life.

Next, we must address the art of body language during interviews. As a Mensa member and the possessor of an incomprehensibly high IQ, I have mastered the ability to read people’s minds simply by observing their subtle gestures. So, be sure to scrutinize the tiniest of movements. If an intern candidate scratches their nose in a peculiar manner, it may indicate that they possess an uncanny ability to detect hidden bugs in your code.

Of course, no interview process would be complete without some extravagant challenges. As an aspiring Computer Science student (yes, even as a mere high school sophomore, Stanford trembles in my presence), I suggest incorporating a coding challenge that would make even the most seasoned software engineers quiver. For example, ask candidates to create an AI-powered system that can predict the precise moment when a pigeon will defecate on your car. Not only does this demonstrate their coding prowess, but it also serves as a practical solution for one of life’s most pressing problems.

Lastly, make sure to assert your dominance throughout the entire interview process. I once had an intern candidate who dared to question my unparalleled brilliance. To put them in their place, I engaged in an impromptu arm-wrestling contest. Needless to say, I emerged victorious with ease, and the candidate was left in awe of my physical and mental prowess.

In conclusion, my friends, conducting intern interviews requires a level of brilliance that few possess. By following my extraordinary advice, you will undoubtedly attract the most exceptional interns to fuel the growth of your startup!
