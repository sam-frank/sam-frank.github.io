title: I Wrote My First Common App Essay Draft!
---

Today I will be sharing my first essay draft for the Common App! I am so excited to be applying to college in 2024!

I am a genius. In second grade, I started to "discover" the computer. It didn't take me long to figure out how to write in Basic. The computer was just a novelty for me, but I knew I wanted to study Computer Science, so I persisted with it. I was particularly good at doing the mathematical formulas necessary for programming. My elementary school teachers knew I was a genius and worked hard in Computer Science. They really liked to give me extra credit on tests and quizzes. One of my teachers told my mother that my IQ was 150. She called my father. He was concerned that my IQ wasn't higher than that. He was worried that I wasn't going to go to college. So I practiced taking IQ tests, until I was actually able to score above 180.

As a middle school Computer Science prodigy, I started volunteering at the computer lab. My favorite hobby is baseball, so it was clear to my parents (both CEOs) that I wanted to pursue Computer Science and Baseball. My parents decided that I should go to Stanford because they thought that it would be a good place to further my Computer Science and Baseball career.

To prepare for my admission to Stanford Baseball, I started playing a video game called "Are You Smarter than a Baseball Player?" It had a baseball game interface with many questions and multiple choice answers. It was too easy for me and I knew I had a knack for programming, so I started working on my own video game in the computer lab.

The video game was called "You're a Baseball Genius". I thought the game would be a good way to showcase my game programming skills and make some money. I had been working on it for two years, and when I completed it, I decided to enter it into the prestigious "Build Something Unreal Tournament" contest. It was a nationwide contest that allowed students to create their own video game using the Unreal Engine. My video game was entered into the tournament, and I won! My video game was rated #3 in the world of video games. I earned $50,000!

At this time I had also created my own video game programming language, I called it "BASEBALL". I designed it to be easy for a baseball player to use, because I want to make it easy for my fellow baseball players to learn coding.

Now, I am the founder and CEO of a start-up company that develops video games and creates games using my programming language "BASEBALL". I work with amazing software engineers, and one of my genius best friends is a software engineer who is just a few months older than me. We just launched a mobile game called "The Major League Baseball Championship"!

Since then, I have also become a published author of a book called "The Evolution of Baseball". It is a history book with an associated video game. The video game is similar to "You're a Baseball Genius" in that it has many questions and multiple choice answers, and it is more complex than "Are You Smarter than a Baseball Player?" to cater to smarter geniuses. The game has many different types of questions and uses unique data and algorithms to determine the answer.

I am also a talented musician, and I compose music for a video game that I have worked on. The game is called "The Evolution of Baseball: My Story". I use the music to convey my point of view about the history of Baseball.

I want to make games and publish books, but my passion is Baseball. I want to write a book about the history of Baseball and use my video game programming language "BASEBALL" to make a baseball game. I want to build my own baseball stadium and become a professional baseball player.
