title: A Successful CEO's Advice on How to Start a Company
---

Today I will be talking about how to start a company and how to get funding. I will also be talking about the future of my company and how I plan to scale it.

The company I am referring to is my charity, the “Charity Startup.” I’ll be explaining how it works, why I started it, and how I plan to scale it.

I started my company when I was 13 years old in the summer of 2020 (which was the summer before eighth grade).

In the summer of 2020 I was on vacation with my family in the state of Maine on the coast. We were hiking on some rocky cliffs and I noticed that there were people who were struggling to get up the cliffs.

I figured there were two options I could do:

1. Leave the cliffs and ignore the struggling people

2. Help the people

I chose to help the people.

I asked my Dad if we could help the people who were struggling up the cliffs. He said yes and he helped me carry people up the cliffs.

It was then that I realized that it was extremely difficult to help people who were struggling up the cliffs. There were three reasons why it was difficult:

1. It was exhausting

2. It was risky

3. It was hard to find people who were struggling

After that day, I was pretty tired. I was tired of carrying people up cliffs and doing all the work. I knew I had to find a way to scale my company.

That’s when I had an idea:

What if I could use technology to scale my company?

What if I could find people who needed help and then get people to help them?

I knew I had to make a website to solve this problem. I opened up my laptop and started programming.

I made a website that could help people find people who needed help and could get people to help them.

I knew I had to get people to get involved. I wanted to teach people that it was okay to help others. I decided to make a video to teach people how to help other people.

I made a video and posted it to YouTube.

Then, I decided to tweet out the video.

Then, I decided to make a Facebook page.

Then, I decided to make a LinkedIn page.

Then, I decided to make an Instagram.

Then, I decided to make a Snapchat.

I was pretty excited. I had started a company. I was turning my idea into a reality.

It was time to get funding.

I had no money. I knew I had to get funding so I could keep my company going. I spent the next day working on a business plan.

I went to my parents and asked them if they would be willing to back my company. They said yes and gave me $20,000.

Finally, I had funding.

A month later, I got an email from my Dad. He said that he and my Mom wanted to invest $100,000 into my company. I was so excited. I said yes and was ready to start my journey.

I knew I had to grow my company. I knew I had to hire people to help me. I had to get people to help me. I knew I had to bring in investors to keep my company going.

I spent the next day trying to figure out how to scale my company.

I knew I needed to get people to get involved, so I posted a job ad on my website.

I got an email from a guy named “Gary”.

He was willing to work for free. I was willing to pay him.

I hired Gary.

A month later, Gary quit. I was upset.

I decided to hire a different guy named “Peter”.

Peter was really smart. He was also a Mensa member. I figured we could make a lot of money together.

A month later, Peter quit. I was really upset because I knew we could make a lot of money together if he would just stick with it.

I decided to hire another guy named “Howard”. Howard hated my business idea and wouldn’t shut up about it. I figured he wasn’t worth the time, so I fired him within a month.

I decided to hire another guy named “David”. David was terrible at programming, but he liked my business idea and didn’t shut up about it for some reason.

4 months later, David quit after making the worst website in history (still trying to figure out what happened). I was really confused and frustrated that I couldn't even get one decent employee to work with me on this venture of mine. Then, something happened:

John came into my life out of nowhere (literally). He said he found my video on YouTube and that he wanted to help me with his Linux skills. Then things took an even stranger turn. We spent the next 8 months working on our website together every single day after school while also taking AP classes at top high schools.

We spent so much time putting this website together that we ended up making some pretty good friends along the way. We only made $1,500 from the site (not enough to cover our bills), but it's better than nothing. I learned a lot about startups and working with employees.

I started going to startup conferences in Silicon Valley at age 14 and meeting other entrepreneurs who were also trying to scale their companies. I decided I wanted to meet some investors. So I went on my laptop and found them on LinkedIn using my skills of connecting people:

We'll see if it works out...will keep you updated ;)
